# How to Run

Most of them are just simple programs that can be executed without arguments
./hello.py


Some take args as shown below

### basic

```
./wordcount.py --count small.txt
./wordcount.py --topcount alice.txt
```

### babynames

`./babynames.py --summaryfile *.html`

Note: Some of them are in python2 while most have been changed to python3 by me.
